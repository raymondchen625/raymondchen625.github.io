First of all, Google Reader is not for everybody. It&#8217;s not as simple as iPhone. Users need to be intellectual enough to grasp it, though they don&#8217;t have to be smart.

Secondly, it has built-in support for Chinese user to work around the GFW. The only thing you need to do is always using it through https. What&#8217;s https? Please refer to Rule No. 1.

Everything you do will be stored in cloud-side. You don&#8217;t need to worry about system reinstallaion and hard disk failure any more.

And it&#8217;s social. You can share good stuffs, and know what your friends are sharing.

And it&#8217;s mobile ready. Actually reading on mobile phone is more fun.
