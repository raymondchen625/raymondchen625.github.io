<div>
  Being carried from the fair
</div>

<div>
  in a see-through plastic bag,
</div>

<div>
  being plopped into a bowl
</div>

<div>
  with another golden lad.
</div>

<div>
  Swimming round a pot pagoda
</div>

<div>
  and a quivering piece of weed,
</div>

<div>
  watching my owner watch the telly &#8212;
</div>

<div>
  he thinks he&#8217;s the referee!
</div>

<div>
  Watching my owner watching me
</div>

<div>
  each and every hour,
</div>

<div>
  waking up to cloudy water &#8212;
</div>

<div>
  it tasted very sour.
</div>

<div>
  Waking up without my mate
</div>

<div>
  because he jumped out of the bowl,
</div>

<div>
  wondering where on earth he&#8217;s gone,
</div>

<div>
  and where&#8217;s his goldfish soul?
</div>

<div>
  Seeing him on the carpet,
</div>

<div>
  frozen stiff and still.
</div>

<div>
  Thinking that won&#8217;t happen to me &#8212;
</div>

<div>
  I&#8217;m going to live until
</div>

<div>
  I&#8217;m 43!
</div>

<div>
  My name is Tish,
</div>

<div>
  I&#8217;m from the North.
</div>

<div>
  You just wait and see!
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
</div>
