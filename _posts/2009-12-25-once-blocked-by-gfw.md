I was told this morning that this blog had been blocked by GFW, as well as the Twitter api and dabr alternative.

Geez. Though I did mention GFW and the technology to work around it in my blogsbefore, I don&#8217;t believe they could draw so much attention of the government. It must be someone else, who happened to share the same IP with me. My site became the collateral damage of Internet censorship.

Then I spent a little more money to get a dedicated IP. Then it&#8217;s done. My blog is back. My life is back. My co-workers, who use my api to access Twitter, are happy.

In the couples of hours of blackout, I switched back to Tor. It&#8217;s soooooo slow, made my feeling of back-to-the-dark-age even stronger.
