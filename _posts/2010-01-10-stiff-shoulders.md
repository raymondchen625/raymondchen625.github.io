Accupuncture is amazing. I came to get the therapy 6 days on daily basis, 4 for shoulders and neck, 2 for back. Now all my back is feeling relieved now.

I can turn my neck to any direction without expecting the roughness. Of course, it still feel a little bit sting when I press the uncomfortable place. But it really feels better now.
