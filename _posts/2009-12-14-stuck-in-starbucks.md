I always can not ssh to my server in the Starbucks near my office. I got it figured out this morning: the cafe had blocked the port 22.

The issue it brings is: no more ssh tunnel in that Starbucks. I don&#8217;t know if Tor is still working there. Since I bought the virtual host service with ssh, I&#8217;ve already uninstalled the Tor. It loooks like the blocking of port 22 has incapacitate my ssh tunnel, which I&#8217;ve been so crazy about.

Will VPN prevail then? I doubt it. They can also block VPN ports if they can do this to ssh port.

I still have no idea how to deal with this, though it doesn&#8217;t cause much inconvenience actually. The only thing I can&#8217;t do is accessing Facebook there.
