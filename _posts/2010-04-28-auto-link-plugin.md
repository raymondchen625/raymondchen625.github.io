I&#8217;m going to look for a WordPressÂ  plug-in, which can suggest links while I type and make the URL link upon my selection. Maybe it can use google to do the search job, and pop up a layter for me to choose. It&#8217;s pretty annoying everytime I need to add a link to my blog text. The whole user experience is counterproductive. It just make me stop thinking.

From the point of SEO, outgoing link is so-called PR leakage, which is not recommended. But what&#8217;s the point if you don&#8217;t add necessary links at all, which might help readers get to the source quickly. SEO can not be paid at the price of reader unfriendly information.
