I&#8217;ve read a post about 15 reasons to live for the next 10 years. The last reason was Lost Return!

Can&#8217;t believe it. Hahaha. I am not a fan of Lost, not any more. At the first 2 or 3 seasons, I could still catch up with the plot. I could even understand their conversation without subtitles. But it became more and more confusing. I was totally lost, even so when Chinese subtitile was put on.

Guess I won&#8217;t expect the last season of Lost, though I may still watch it, if I happen to have it.
