I&#8217;ve released my new Greasemonkey Script, <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/82789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClassicRetweetFor163Weibo</a>, today. It took me two days to finish the first version, starting from last noon.

I barely remembered the tricks of GM, so I had to read the book again, partially. The developer of 163weibo uses very complicated javascript library, which injects event to DOM elements. It&#8217;s difficult to find those snippets deserve my attntion. But anyway I did it.

And on Sean&#8217;s demand, I improved it a little bit. Now it uses the standard opost input box to retweet. ^_^
