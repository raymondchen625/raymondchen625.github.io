The whole June has a topic, failure. I failed to keep up with my items in my plan, professional or personal. I was a little bit confused by my data loss, which should not be a good excuse.

For jogging, it turned out better than I&#8217;d thought. Though not very good from the calendar record, I&#8217;ve kept the once per 2-3 days rhythm. If everything is fine, I will jog every other day. But sometimes my left knee gets sore, then I will put off another day.

I&#8217;d finished 70% of &#8220;The Great Gatsby&#8221; when I decided to read it from the beginning again. It needs a little more attention to understand, not like Jack Reacher series.
