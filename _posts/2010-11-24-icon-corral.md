I thought of a software that I loved very much last decade. It was designed for Windows 95. Yes, Windows 95, the classic and obsolete Windows OS. I finally figured out its name, Icon Corral.

I googled it. To my surprise, I found it! <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,1603-order,1-page,1-c,alldownloads/description.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is the link</a>.

It is used to put any window title on taskbar to the system tray when it is minized. Pretty simple. Such feature will be soon be included by the upgrade of OS, just like thousands of other features.
