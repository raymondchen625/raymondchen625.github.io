I found goodreads.com wonderful. And I&#8217;ve recommended it to Sean, my co-worker.

Some book reviews are so great. They are even better than the book itself. This is like the English version of Douban.com. But it fucuses on books only, and books in English only.

It&#8217;s like going to Douban for a movie review after watching it. When I&#8217;ve finished a book, good or not, I&#8217;d like to check what other readers would say about it.

The site also has many fancy features, like flash gadget, auto-link to twitter. It will be perfect if it can recommend books automatically for me.
