Dropbox is a cool software.

I didn&#8217;t expect it could impres me that much. The idea is not new. What it does is just to automatically synchronize our files between diffrent machine, as well as to store a backup on the website. It supports file versioning, which Subversion also can do.

I thought it&#8217;s cool since I found out its major advantage over SVN. You don&#8217;t need to see those hidden .svn folder anymore. Your folder is clean and tidy. I&#8217;m using the free edition now, which gives me 2.5G space.

If I need more space, the price is $99 per year for 50G space. It&#8217;s a little bit high. I think $39 will be OK for me IF it can provide extra features like:

1. Online editing. Better integrated with Google Docs or something like that.

2. Change Tracking. For largeÂ  file, a small change leading to a long upload is nightmare. At least for some common file types, like text and office files, it can figure out a way to just upload the &#8216;change&#8217;, not the whole file.

3. Better security. If I&#8217;m going to store all my files there, I need to a mechanism to classify my files. Some files may be downloaded to local disk, but still can not be accessed without extra authorization.
