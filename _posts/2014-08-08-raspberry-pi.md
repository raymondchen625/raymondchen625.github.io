Yes, it is a Raspberry Pi.

I finally decided to turn off the Dell server in my basement, which hosted a bunch of VM&#8217;s and consuming around 100W of power, I guess. Got to go green.

The VM&#8217;s on my dell server were used to host my WordPress blog, the one I&#8217;m using right now, a PPTP VPN for my friends in China to get around the Great Firewall,  a Dabr web application for them to access Twitter in China without using VPN, and a uTorrent application running as BitTorrent peer.

All of them are on my Raspberry Pi now! WordPress is slow when dynamic pages are requested. I think that&#8217;s because the Transmission, which eats up CPU cycles when downloading from peer, is the cause. I&#8217;ll see how it goes when the download finishes. It&#8217;s just a credit-size mini computer running on SD card, not SSD! Can&#8217;t expect too much.
