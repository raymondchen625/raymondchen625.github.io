I&#8217;ve been traveling with some colleagues to Jeju, South Korea this week. Something is unexpected: free wifi can be found in many public area. Checking in 4sq becomes easy.  
But we still found going around the city not easy due to the language barrier. For a city whose income comes mostly from tourism, it should make the navigation much easier.  
Free mobile data plan for tourist is a good start. Let tourist rent a sim card in the airport, for free os at a very low price. The city might also provide free navigation software, android and iPhone. Users Can display information of a place multilingually.  
In fact, this job can be done by google. Google already has geo data in many languages. Google need to provide an offline version of google map. And the city just need to cooperate with google in data gathering, or at least don&#8217;t get in the way.
