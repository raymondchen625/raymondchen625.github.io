There are usually some shopping sprees occured after I get a new electronic gadget.

After I bought the Nexus One, I&#8217;d bought two batteries with travel charger, one key ring that can be used as flash disk and charging cable, two android apps from the Market and a waterproof bag used in swimming.

After I bought the iPad, I&#8217;d bought two cases(the former one really sucked, so&#8230;), two Apple Store Gift Cards ($15 & $25) which enabled me to have bought 4 apps until now.

And I&#8217;ve bought some ebooks, which didn&#8217;t count&#8211; I&#8217;d buy them anyway.
