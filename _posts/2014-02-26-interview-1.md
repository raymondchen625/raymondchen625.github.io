I had my first interview in Canada on Mar. 24, 2014.

I thought about taking a photo in the reception area to record this big day, but I gave up after seeing the &#8220;no camera&#8221; sign. Later I took one in the parking lot.

I am not sure how many interviews will I take before I get my first offer. My own rational expectation is 10+. The less the better of course. But I can only get a second after the first one. Yeah, I was excited.

The two interviewers were both nice. We talked about many technical stuffs. I found myself a little bit happier after I went out, not just because they were nice, but also because we talked tech! I became a little bit tech talking hungry these days. It has been more than 4 months since I quit my last job, nobody talked to me on technical topics since then. I missed my everyday stand-up meeting and the technical sharing session.

There were many overlaps between the job requirement and my skills. The gentleman made an introduction of what the application they were developing does. It&#8217;s not hard to understand. I think I am qualified for the job. But that is not my decision, and it depends on how the interviewers think and how good my competitors do ^_^. But I really appreciate that the company, the HR staffs and the interviewers have given me the interview opportunity. It means a lot to me(maybe I should take the photo in reception anyway! Haha).

I was a little bit frustrated by my spoken English. I slowed down when I was trying to find the right words to express myself. I need more practice. I feel horrible when I make myself look less competent for a skill I am very good at, just because the language ability gets in my way.

I like the parking lot and the environment of the company, while I didn&#8217;t have a chance to seeÂ other sections. And it is quite close to where I live. 6 minute&#8217;s drive. I could even walk to work in summer, getting a coffee in Timmy on the way. Sounds wonderful!

Whatever it turns out, I think the break of the career I am enjoying now is precious. When developers work for a job, using some kind of technology, they lose the time or opportunity to learn other technologies, or even other parts of the same technology which are irrelevant to their job&#8217;s application scenario. We rarely have time to fill those gaps. Now it&#8217;s good for me to review my skill set, doing some self-learning at home to improve some skills I&#8217;ve always been wanting to learn, frameworks, libraries, theory and tools, anything interesting. Maybe I can grasp Redis or some open-source PHP-based e-commerce apps before my next job comes. Who knows?
