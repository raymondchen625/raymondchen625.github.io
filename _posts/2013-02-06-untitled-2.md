2012 is a chaotic year. But looking back, I found the chaos is not necessary bad. I&#8217;ve seen and learnt, people and techs. Anyway, I&#8217;m happy that my development team has become a more efficient and capable one. Though not without weakness, it is quite ready for the challenge of 2013.

I put two books to my online shopping cart, but didn&#8217;t finish the purchase later. The reason was that I still have too many unfinished books. I&#8217;m now reading: Code Complete 2, An Introduction to the History of Western Europe. Black Swan and The Path to Freedom were started but are now in inactive status.

About jogging, I&#8217;m trying to pick up from very low-level exercise. Jogging in very low speed, I could have an idea of how much my knees can take.

I&#8217;m going to stay in Hong Kong for two days during the CNY holidays. Buy some mainland-censored books perhaps. And I&#8217;ll try a unlimited-data 3G sim card there, which was bought from Taobao with a very low price.
