When I walked in the hospital this morning, everything was fine. But I sorta limped when I walked out of it. That&#8217;s because the nurse applied some ointment and bandage around my left knee, which was the source of my weird gait.

It&#8217;s not big deal, the doctor told me. But I&#8217;d have to stop jogging for 2-3 months.

Fine, no jogging. Then I went for the dumbbell exercise with my co-workers this afternoon. There is a huge gym room on 10th floor,Â  in which there are full of fitness equipments. After the exausting weight lifting, my shoulder really felt much better when I used the mouse again, at least for half an hour.
