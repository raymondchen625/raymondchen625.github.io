2010.1.13 is even more hilarious than 1.12, when the news of Google leaving China detonated the whole Chinese Internet. All IM groups were filled up with discussion. Some colleagues, who I&#8217;m proud of, went to Goolge&#8217;s building in Beijing, leaving bunches of flower to show their respect.  
It&#8217;s history. And when all this happened, I was in a stupid meeting in Tianhe Studium.
