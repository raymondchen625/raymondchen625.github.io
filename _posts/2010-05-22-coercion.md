I had this feeling before. But I didn&#8217;t figure out that word, coercion, until hearing in in one talk show about Facebook.

Yes, if all your friends are using Facebook to interactive, it is sort of a coercion. It looks like that you still have a choice, but actually you don&#8217;t, not in the way they care.

This is like pop music star. The best way to beat it, is to work out more attractive alternatives.
