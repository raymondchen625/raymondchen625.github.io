I bought a Sony Reader PRS-600.

It&#8217;s satisfactory. The touch-screen is convenient. I can hightlight words and sentences, draw free lines, or double tap to look up words in dictionary. I&#8217;ve checked Kindle out. But gave it up due to its lack of touch-screen. And Kindle supports its proprieatary format only(It looks like planning to support PDF in the future).

But I was a little bit crazy when I found that the ebook website of Sony only accepts US/Canada credit card. And they validate the card strictly. After online chatting with the support staff, I had the bad feeling that I would have to return the gadget.

Luckily, I searched and found out that I can do the purchasing on other websites. Some of them claim that the purchase is for US/Canada resident only. But they don&#8217;t check it very seriously. And I successfully bought a book!

I&#8217;ve read some FAQ&#8217;s of those web sites. Actually it&#8217;s an outdated policy of the US book publisher industry. The book websites&#8217; sales are hurt by such policy. They are also complaining and demanding for change. Anyway, thanks to multiple-format support of Sony reader, I still can somehow to work around.

If I can buy a book at Borders of San Fransico Airport and bring it back to China legally, why can&#8217;t I buy it online? They&#8217;re really outdated and stupid policies.
