A little bit burnt out from the CKA exam and other stuffs and the subsequent reading to pay up my tech debts on theory. It has been hard for me to research on tedious stuffs now. I usually take this opportunity to hone my skills on tools, which is basically physical. Just repetitive practice to build the muscle memory.

Then I found [ShortcutFoo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com)! I subscribed and covered VIM and Sublime Text Editor already. Maybe I should work on Eclipse, which I believe I&#8217;m already very good. But there might be surprise.
