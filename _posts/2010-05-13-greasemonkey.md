Greasemonkey is so easy. If you are familar with JavaScript, you&#8217;ve literally already known it.

With the help of the free PDF from <a href="http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diveintogreasemonkey.org</a>, learning and finishing my first app only took me an hour. I&#8217;ve not finished the book yet, and I don&#8217;t have to.

The first one is simple, just replacing some keyword in the web page. And I finished my second app this morning. It can help me fill the form automatically, quite useful when I need to bulk-register lots of account.

It&#8217;s an itch-scratching product, with very flat learning curve.
