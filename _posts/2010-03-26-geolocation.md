Quite obssessed with geolocation stuffs lately. I was so impressed when I saw Firefox successfully located me while I was connected with my home wifi. I didn&#8217;t understand how it did it. Since I&#8217;d never registered my wifi before. I did some research and finally figured out the basic mechanism.

It&#8217;s funny. And I&#8217;ve added so many wifi access points to Skyhook&#8217;s database, including the one in Starbucks, my home and those of my neighbours.

And I started to use Foursquare. Such user-update model is cool. It only works in an open society. Anyway, I&#8217;ve added many cafes, Chinese restaurants to foursquare.
