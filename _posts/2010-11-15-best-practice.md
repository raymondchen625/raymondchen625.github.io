When you feel it&#8217;s enough repeating same errors at the same place, you will try to learn from those lessons, trying to figure some rules to follow, which enable you to avoid those mistake from happening again. That&#8217;s how &#8220;Best Practice&#8221; comes. There are so many books about them. For some experienced programmers, they try not to make those mistakes even for once. But there are still some who would argue with you. When you try to convince them not to hard code, they say they can finish the job faster. It&#8217;s hard to make your case since they do finish the job in less time.

So I think we should have some sort of course or workshop. We deliberately arrange some scenarios in which programmers would violate those best practice. And let them go through the pain themselves. That might help them understand the importance of best practice, converting the reading experience into a personal one.
