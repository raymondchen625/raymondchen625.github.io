We watched &#8220;Lie to me&#8221; last night, episode 8-9 of season 1. Without subtitles, I really didn&#8217;t follow. It&#8217;s too hard. Tim Roth&#8217;s voice was always so challenging&#8230; My friends said season 2 is much better, the story itself. Maybe, cuz I also found the actors were a little bit exaggerating, though I didn&#8217;t quite understading their words.

Comparatively, Hillary Clinton&#8217;s speeach on internet freedom was amazing. I listened to it live without missing any phrase, I guess. Public speech is basic skill of polititian. Obama also did well, maybe better. And there are some CNN anchors I like very much: Michael Holmes, John King, Rosemary Church and Colleen Edwards. Their speaking are crystal clear, a requisite for their profession and an encouragment to my English learning.
