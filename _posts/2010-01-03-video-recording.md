I didn&#8217;t found video recording any fun until I won an Ipod Nano in the lucky draw of the annual dinner of my company. The gadget can be used to record video. But it does not support static picture shooting, which is weird. Maybe it&#8217;s too small to put a zooming camera on it.  
When Gerald is getting his bath, or Alpha is jumping up and down like a monkey. It&#8217;s convenient to grab the Ipod and shoot some footage.  
When we are bored on the trip, we can take out the ipod to review the sweet feed of our pets&#8217; life.
