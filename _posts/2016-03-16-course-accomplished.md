It took me 11 weeks to finish the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) course on Coursera. And got the [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/JWVTJ8QFZP3Z).

It was painful when I was using my long-forgotten linear algebra knowledge to work on the logistic regression, neural network and support vector machine assignments. But the course is designed to be achievable byÂ people like me, which has left out some complicated details.

It was like an informative tour. I couldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m ready to solve any real world problem with the knowledge I learned. But I know more right now.

NLP might be interesting for my next adventure. But my mind needs some rest. I might enjoy some world history videos on [KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) first, as a break.
