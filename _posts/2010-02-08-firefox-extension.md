After some online reading, I tried and modified an sample project of Firefox Extension. It worked. A simple add-on with new menu items, popup different window upon different click.

The framework, directory structure and convention is not hard to understand. Programing is all about JavaScript and XML. Of course, to make good applications, we have to grasp XUL and XPCom.
