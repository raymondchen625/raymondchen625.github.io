Just finished migrating WordPress blog to GitHub Pages.

Text in my posts are fine. But some pictures are lost. Most of them were already lost during my previous move from self-hosted WP to official WP. Also found Foursquare genereated posts could no longer display the pictuers due to policy change on its AWS storage service, which no longer allows external reference. I have to live with all these.

Anyway, Jekyll seems cool. Love the idea of all-static pages blog.
