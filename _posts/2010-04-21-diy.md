Twitter bought an app. What&#8217;s it supposed to mean?

From an article on Newsweek, the developers didn&#8217;t react as radically as expected. Some say it&#8217;s not that bad. It will set a higher entry bar for new app developers. They do have a point. I&#8217;m so confused when I browse the clients on <a href="http://oneforty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oneforty</a>. There are just too many. Too many choices is as bad as no choice at all.

Will Twitter take advantage of its position as an API designer? That&#8217;s really hard to say. There is no such thing as a Open API License, which restricts the API designers from keeping secret or taking timing advantage to make their own client more competitive.

Can a platform provider also be an applicaiton designer? Prohibiting such thing seems stupid. But I think there is at least some agreement, license or even regulation to address this issue.
