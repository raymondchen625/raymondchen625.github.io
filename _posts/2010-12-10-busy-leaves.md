You will be much busier when you are between jobs, that&#8217;s what my friend said. That&#8217;s true. I took four days of annual leaves this week, before the termination of my current employment. I&#8217;ll still go to work next full week, and then start another two week of annual leaves.

I was quite busy last four days. In the first half, I was focusing on the past. But my focus had turned to the future in the second half. I&#8217;ve met some people, talked to some guys and taken much time to think. I&#8217;ve seen some bros facing difficult decision. And I know I have to make my own some day.

Leaving the old comfortable zone is not easy for everybody. This time, I am a little bit excited. I know no matter how I choose, it cannot be perfect. But I am just soooooo ready.
