After buying iPad and iTouch, I&#8217;ve bought many accessories. I always introduced them to my friens when I felt they were good. The result is not so good, luckily sales is not my profession.

The sketch pen for iPad, which I&#8217;ve bought the 2nd one, could not be sold to any of my friends.

The tiny bluetooth keyboard was only bought by Henry.

The small charging adapter, which converts A/C to USB output and can be used to charge iPad, can not make a sale. But I&#8217;ve made the 2nd order this afternoon. 

The deluxe insinde-ear earbuds, which can prevent up to 85% noise when its power is turned on is good. I never tried to promoting it to anyone. I think the requirement is not common. It could be a little bit inconvenient if being used at home. But in a noisy environment like Starbucks, it really creates a quiet private space..

The iPhone holder is goood. It can support my iTouch standing in a tilted angle, good for watching podcast.
