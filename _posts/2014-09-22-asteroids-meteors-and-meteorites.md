Asteroids are small bodies that orbit the Sun as the Earth does Larger asteroids are called planetoids or minor planets, smaller ones often called meteoroids Once any of these enters our planet&#8217;s atmosphere, it becomes a meteor Many meteors break into pieces or burn up entirely as they speed through the atmosphere Once meteors or fragments actually hit the earth&#8217;s surface, they become meteorites.
