I tried to download GlassfishESB from Sun website earlier. It took me almost 15 minutes to finally locate it!  
Since Oracle&#8217;s acquisition, Sun&#8217;s website has changed a lot. And I didn&#8217;t know that. Many web pages are redirected to Oracle now.  
Everybody knows how ugly Oracle&#8217;s webstie is. Oracle can only make good DB and sell it. And Sun is inevitably moving to that ugly-website direction. Sigh&#8230;
