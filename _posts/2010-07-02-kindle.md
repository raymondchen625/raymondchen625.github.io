â€œBuy once, read everywhere&#8221;, I love this statement of Amazon Kindle.

I&#8217;ve used Sony Reader for a year. I chose it over Kindle because of its touch screen. Double-tap to look up words is a good feature.

Then I saw Kindler for PC, Kindle for MAC. I didn&#8217;t get Amazon&#8217;s idea until I installed Kindle for Android lately. Yes, that&#8217;s &#8220;buy once, read everywhere&#8221;. The most annoying thing of DRM is the binding to device. Digital is supposed to be read on multiple devices. What&#8217;s the point of binding to one?

Amazon knew this. It sees itself a platform, rather than a reader manufacturer. Sony is still a manufacturer. If it wants to get its slice in the ebook market share, do something. Ditch the stupid DRM.
