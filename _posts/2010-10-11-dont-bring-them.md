I&#8217;ve brought many stuffs, which were rarely used, in my recent tour to Hawaii. I should consider leaving them at home on my next trip.

1. Cellphone Car Rack

Used:  Never

I planned to use it to hold my Nexus One for navigation while I was driving. It turned out my preinstalled GPS software didn&#8217;t work. And my main navigation tool was my iPad, which displayed an offline Google map with directions to navigate. And it was being hold in Ida&#8217;s hands all the time. The rack is only useful when I am driving alone.

2. Telescope

Used： Never

It was not Yellowstone. There were not so many wild lifes, I meant mammals, in Hawaii, which requires a telescope to get a good observation. I never bothered to take it out from my backpack in my tour.

3. Digital Camera Charger

I&#8217;m not a big fan of photography. It turned out that I had only taken less than 300 pictures, which only consumed one battery bar. With two fully-charged batteries, I don&#8217;t need to bring the charger next time.

4. Wireless Mouse

Used:  Once

If I&#8217;d sticked to my iPad all the time, I didn&#8217;t need that mouse at all.

5. Waterproof Plastic Bags

Used: Never

I brought two of those bags, one for cellphone and the other for digital camera. They&#8217;ve never got wet.

6. Network Cable Roll

Used: Never

I brought a cable with a device that can automatically roll back the cable. It&#8217;s never been used. All the guest room had provied cables.
