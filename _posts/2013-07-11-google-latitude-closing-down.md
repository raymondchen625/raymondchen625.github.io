[Google Latitude is closing down](http://www.techinvestornews.com/Google/Google-Bloggers/google-latitude-closing-down-on-august-9)Â on August 9, 2013.

It&#8217;s not a big deal as the close of Google Reader. With so many alternatives popping up, the close of Google Reader was painless.

Latitude has become less and less used among my friends. There are so many alternatives. And most people think a little bit uneasy letting friends know where they are 24&#215;7.

It is said that the Latitude will become an integral part of Google Plus. That&#8217;s a good idea, which actually saves the location-based service by turning it into a function, rather than an independent product.
