I&#8217;ve been spending quite some time trying to find an alternative for the non-official Twitter site, 80sfamily.com, which enables me to access twitter from the browsers of my cellphone. Its version is outdated, I guess. The RT function doesn&#8217;t work.  
I&#8217;ve installed Birdnest API on my Google App Engine, which is bird625.appspot.com. But it is for Client Application only, such as Gravity or Twhirl. I need an applicaiton which supports browser directly.  
Here comes <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dabr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dabr</a>,which I should have found it much earlier. The installation was a breeze. Just unzip, change a filename, and edit to define a new key. That&#8217;s it. And with the updated version, the RT works!
