It&#8217;s the first working day after Lunar New Year. In local traditional, the new year period lasts for 15 days. People stop giving Red Packages, which are small cash only handed out in new year, from the 16th day on.

So, no red package, and the polluted air hangs on. It&#8217;s not as humid as days before. But without the fog, we still can&#8217;t see the blue sky. Blue sky is luxury here.

And I spent almost an hour in the road, most of the time being stuck in the traffic. Next time when I go to work from Tianhe district, I should consider taking the Zhongshan Da Dao, which has BRT&#8217;s.
