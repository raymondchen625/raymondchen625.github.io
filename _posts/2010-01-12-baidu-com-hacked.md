Baidu.com was cracked this morning. It&#8217;s sensational. Most of our colleagues were happy on this news. In our eyes, Baidu.com is a bad company, who is willing to be evil, on the contrary of Google.  
It&#8217;s said that Iranian Cyber Army did it. It&#8217;s funny. Isn&#8217;t this sort of friendly fire?
