Looking back has become a  luxury lately. Since my first day on board to my new company, workload and reponsiblity are so huge that I don&#8217;t even have time to think about last year and my last employer, until some co-worker brought up the topic this morning: change.

The only thing that would not change is change itself. We have moved from our comfortable zone to this new frontier. Our familiar roles are either need to be expanded, or changed dramatically.  That means opportunity. Some may not be so ready, but they have to finish that change of mindset ASAP. We should all be able see this thrilling prospect. I think the only proof we need is 1-2 projects with good performance. I believe I&#8217;ve a wonderful team. And we are on the right track, heading to another fantastic adventure.
