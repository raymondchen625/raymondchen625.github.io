I have read these tech books in 2017.

  * Introduction to React<img class=" size-full wp-image-1504 alignright" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/techbooks.jpeg" alt="techbooks" width="224" height="225" srcset="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/techbooks.jpeg 224w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/techbooks-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" />
  * NG-Book Angular 4
  * Head First Android Development
  * Vagrant Up and Running
  * Kubernetes up and Running
  * Hacker Exposed 7th Edition
  * The Docker Cookbook
  * Docker Up and Running
  * D3 in Action

Reading books is not the only way I learn techs. Like Kubernetes, I&#8217;ve read the official docs many times while running tests. The Kubernetes Up and Running book was more of a review, which I did after I had understanding of most of the concepts.

Sometimes I think it&#8217;s not the best way, or it&#8217;s lazy or too laid-back for myself. Getting my hands on it is always the best and fun way. But I will still read some books in 2018 due to: 1) It could be a comprehensive summary, sometimes covers some areas I will ignore; 2) It leads me to some interesting topics/books/tools/stories I have never heard ofÂ  before
