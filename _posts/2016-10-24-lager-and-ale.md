A lager is one of the two main overarching beer types in the world. The other type is <a href="http://berghoffbeer.com/blog/what-is-ale-different-types-of-ales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called an ale</a>. What really differentiates these two is the type of yeast used in fermentation during the brewing process. Ales use “top-fermenting” yeast strains, which ferment at the top of the fermentation container. Lagers, on the other hand, have “bottom-fermenting” yeasts, which ferment at the bottom of a fermentation container. Easy enough, right? The different types of yeast typically call for different temperatures. Usually, lagers are brewed at cooler temperatures than ales.
