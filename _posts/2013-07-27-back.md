Back from America. I fell very tired, not because of the long drive everyday, but of the incoming uncertainty I got to deal with after coming back. And I&#8217;ve spent quite some portion of my fun time thinking about it.

Sequoia is beautiful, so is Stanford campus.

I ate so many beefs, good of cuz, but I&#8217;ve to figure out ways to lose the extra weight.

I&#8217;ve finished &#8220;1984&#8221; and another Jack Reacher novel, Bad Luck and Trouble, on my journey. ^_^
