Well, Nobunaga 13 is too hard for me. I don&#8217;t know any one of the characters. And some of the text are still Japanese! Now I switch to Europa Universalis III. It&#8217;s in English, which at least I can consult a dictionary.

I always imagine that there is a gadget can help me to turn off the light and TV set at the blink of my eyes. Sometimes I feel dozy while watching TV in bed, when illusion is taking over. If I fall asleep then, I may have a wonderful dream. But I&#8217;ve to turn off the TV and lights. That brings me sobriety, which I don&#8217;t need at that time. When I come back to sleep, that wonderful feeling is gone.
