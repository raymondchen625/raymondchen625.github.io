Just began to read the e-book &#8220;Google SEO Secrets&#8221;. It&#8217;s short, with only around 100 pages.

It&#8217;s good. I&#8217;ve known some concepts of SEO before. But this book still provides some new ideas and methods. The most important part is, it&#8217;s not hard at all. Nothing beyond my understanding.

This (type of) book is must-read for guys who operate websites, I think.
