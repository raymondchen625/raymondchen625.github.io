<p>I put two books to my online shopping cart, but didn’t finish the purchase later. The reason was that I still have too many unfinished books. I’m now reading: Code Complete 2, An Introduction to the History of Western Europe. Black Swan and The Path to Freedom were started but are now in inactive status.</p>

<p>About jogging, I’m trying to pick up from very low-level exercise. Jogging in very low speed, I could have an idea of how much my knees can take.</p>

<p>I’m going to stay in Hong Kong for two days during the CNY holidays. Buy some mainland-censored books perhaps. And I’ll try a unlimited-data 3G sim card there, which was bought from Taobao with a very low price.</p>
