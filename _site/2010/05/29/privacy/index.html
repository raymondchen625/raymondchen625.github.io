Maybe your privacy is well-protected now by the service provider. But who knows whether in the future it will merge, cooperate with or even be acquired by a company controlled by a North-Korea-friendly regime. By then, do you want to or remember to delete all your data? Even you do so, your data can still be recovered from backup archive.
