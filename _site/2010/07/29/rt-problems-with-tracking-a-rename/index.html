<meta name="description" content="[extract from book Version Control with Git] Tracking the renaming of a file engenders a perennial debate among developers of version control systems. A simple rename is fodder enough for dissension. The argument becomes even more heated when the file’s name changes and then its content changes. Then the scenarios turn the parley from practical to philosophical: Is that “new” file really a rename, or is it merely similar to the old one? How similar should the new file be before it’s considered the same file? If you apply someone’s patch that deletes a file and recreates a similar one elsewhere, how is that managed? What happens if a file is renamed in two different ways on two different branches? Is it less error-prone to automatically detect renames in such a situation, as Git does, or to require the user to explicitly identify renames, as Subversion does? In real-life use, it seems that Git’s system for handling file renames is superior, because there are just too many ways for a file to be renamed, and humans are simply not smart enough to make sure Subversion knows about them all. But there is no perfect system for handling renames…yet." />

Tracking the renaming of a file engenders a perennial debate among developers of<br />
version control systems.<br />
A simple rename is fodder enough for dissension. The argument becomes even more<br />
heated when the file’s name changes and then its content changes. Then the scenarios<br />
turn the parley from practical to philosophical: Is that “new” file really a rename, or is<br />
it merely similar to the old one? How similar should the new file be before it’s considered<br />
the same file? If you apply someone’s patch that deletes a file and recreates a similar<br />
one elsewhere, how is that managed? What happens if a file is renamed in two different<br />
ways on two different branches? Is it less error-prone to automatically detect renames<br />
in such a situation, as Git does, or to require the user to explicitly identify renames, as<br />
Subversion does?<br />
In real-life use, it seems that Git’s system for handling file renames is superior, because<br />
there are just too many ways for a file to be renamed, and humans are simply not smart<br />
enough to make sure Subversion knows about them all. But there is no perfect system<br />
for handling renames…yet.</p>
