<p>This conversation sends two messages:</p>

<p>1) The fear of public expression of political viewpoints is planted to many people’s hearts.</p>

<p>2) It’s safe to criticize our government when you are nobody. But if you become famous, that could be another story.</p>

<p>A taxi driver told me last week: One of his friend, also a taxi driver, once said something stupid, maybe critizing the system, the party or anything that annoyed his passengers. His passengers happened to be some national security officials. He later got called back to his taxi center, some officials waiting for him. And he got locked up for 48 hours.</p>
