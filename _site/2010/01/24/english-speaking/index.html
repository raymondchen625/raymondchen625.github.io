    <p>We watched “Lie to me” last night, episode 8-9 of season 1. Without subtitles, I really didn’t follow. It’s too hard. Tim Roth’s voice was always so challenging… My friends said season 2 is much better, the story itself. Maybe, cuz I also found the actors were a little bit exaggerating, though I didn’t quite understading their words.</p>

<p>Comparatively, Hillary Clinton’s speeach on internet freedom was amazing. I listened to it live without missing any phrase, I guess. Public speech is basic skill of polititian. Obama also did well, maybe better. And there are some CNN anchors I like very much: Michael Holmes, John King, Rosemary Church and Colleen Edwards. Their speaking are crystal clear, a requisite for their profession and an encouragment to my English learning.</p>
